# FighterJet

## This project aims to write a flight simulator in Unity 3D game engine (using C# programming language) . 

The behaviour of the plane is intended to be as realistic as possible . Rather than copying the behaviour , we are manipulating the forces based on real time aerodyanamic forces on the Plane
